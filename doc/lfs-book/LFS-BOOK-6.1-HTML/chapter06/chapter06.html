        <p>
          In this chapter, we enter the building site and start constructing
          the LFS system in earnest. That is, we chroot into the temporary
          mini Linux system, make a few final preparations, and then begin
          installing the packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The installation of this software is straightforward. Although in
          many cases the installation instructions could be made shorter and
          more generic, we have opted to provide the full instructions for
          every package to minimize the possibilities for mistakes. The key
          to learning what makes a Linux system work is to know what each
          package is used for and why the user (or the system) needs it. For
          every installed package, a summary of its contents is given,
          followed by concise descriptions of each program and library the
          package installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If using the compiler optimizations provided in this chapter,
          please review the optimization hint at <a href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/optimization.txt">
          <i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/optimization.txt</i></a>.
          Compiler optimizations can make a program run slightly faster, but
          they may also cause compilation difficulties and problems when
          running the program. If a package refuses to compile when using
          optimization, try to compile it without optimization and see if
          that fixes the problem. Even if the package does compile when using
          optimization, there is the risk it may have been compiled
          incorrectly because of the complex interactions between the code
          and build tools. The small potential gains achieved in using
          compiler optimizations are often outweighed by the risks.
          First-time builders of LFS are encouraged to build without custom
          optimizations. The subsequent system will still run very fast and
          be stable at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The order that packages are installed in this chapter needs to be
          strictly followed to ensure that no program accidentally acquires a
          path referring to <tt class="filename">/tools</tt> hard-wired into
          it. For the same reason, do not compile packages in parallel.
          Compiling in parallel may save time (especially on dual-CPU
          machines), but it could result in a program containing a hard-wired
          path to <tt class="filename">/tools</tt>, which will cause the
          program to stop working when that directory is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the installation instructions, each installation page
          provides information about the package, including a concise
          description of what it contains, approximately how long it will
          take to build, how much disk space is required during this building
          process, and any other packages needed to successfully build the
          package. Following the installation instructions, there is a list
          of programs and libraries (along with brief descriptions of these)
          that the package installs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep track of which package installs particular files, a package
          manager can be used. For a general overview of different styles of
          package managers, please refer to <a href=

          <i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/introduction/important.html</i></a>.
          For a package management method specifically geared towards LFS, we
          recommend <a href=
