            1.1. How to Build an LFS System
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The LFS system will be built by using a previously installed Linux
          distribution (such as Debian, Mandrake, Red Hat, or SuSE). This
          existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting point
          to provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker, and
          shell, to build the new system. Select the &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">development</span>&rdquo; option during the distribution
          installation to be able to access these tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an alternative to installing an entire separate distribution
          onto your machine, you may wish to use the Linux From Scratch
          LiveCD. The CD works well as a host system, providing all the tools
          you need to successfully follow the instructions in this book.
          Additionally, it contains all the source packages, patches and a
          copy of this book. So once you have the CD, no network connection
          or additional downloads are necessary. For more information about
          the LFS LiveCD or to download a copy, visit <a href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/"><i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="../chapter02/chapter02.html">Chapter 2</a> of this book
          describes how to create a new Linux native partition and file
          system, the place where the new LFS system will be compiled and
          installed. <a href="../chapter03/chapter03.html">Chapter 3</a>
          explains which packages and patches need to be downloaded to build
          an LFS system and how to store them on the new file system.
          <a href="../chapter04/chapter04.html">Chapter 4</a> discusses the
          setup for an appropriate working environment. Please read <a href=
          "../chapter04/chapter04.html">Chapter 4</a> carefully as it
          explains several important issues the developer should be aware of
          before beginning to work through <a href=
          "../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> explains the
          installation of a number of packages that will form the basic
          development suite (or toolchain) which is used to build the actual
          system in <a href="../chapter06/chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>. Some
          of these packages are needed to resolve circular
          dependencies&mdash;for example, to compile a compiler, you need a
          compiler.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> also shows the
          user how to build a first pass of the toolchain, including Binutils
          and GCC (first pass basically means these two core packages will be
          re-installed a second time). The next step is to build Glibc, the C
          library. Glibc will be compiled by the toolchain programs built in
          the first pass. Then, a second pass of the toolchain will be built.
          This time, the toolchain will be dynamically linked against the
          newly built Glibc. The remaining <a href=
          "../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> packages are built
          using this second pass toolchain. When this is done, the LFS
          installation process will no longer depend on the host
          distribution, with the exception of the running kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this may initially seem like a lot of work to isolate the new
          system from the host distribution, a full technical explanation is
          provided at the beginning of <a href=
          "../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <a href="../chapter06/chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>, the full
          LFS system is built. The <span><strong class=
          "command">chroot</strong></span> (change root) program is used to
          enter a virtual environment and start a new shell whose root
          directory will be set to the LFS partition. This is very similar to
          rebooting and instructing the kernel to mount the LFS partition as
          the root partition. The system does not actually reboot, but
          instead <span><strong class="command">chroot</strong></span>'s
          because creating a bootable system requires additional work which
          is not necessary just yet. The major advantage is that
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">chrooting</span>&rdquo; allows the
          builder to continue using the host while LFS is being built. While
          waiting for package compilation to complete, a user can switch to a
          different virtual console (VC) or X desktop and continue using the
          computer as normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          To finish the installation, the LFS-Bootscripts are set up in
          <a href="../chapter07/chapter07.html">Chapter 7</a>, and the kernel
          and boot loader are set up in <a href=
          "../chapter08/chapter08.html">Chapter 8</a>. <a href=
          "../chapter09/chapter09.html">Chapter 9</a> contains information on
          furthering the LFS experience beyond this book. After the steps in
          this book have been implemented, the computer will be ready to
          reboot into the new LFS system.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on each
          step is discussed in the following chapters and package
          descriptions. Items that may seem complicated will be clarified,
          and everything will fall into place as the reader embarks on the
          LFS adventure.
