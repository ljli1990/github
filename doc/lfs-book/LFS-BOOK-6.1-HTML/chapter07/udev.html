          7.4. Device and Module Handling on an LFS System
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        In <a href="../chapter06/chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>, we installed
        the Udev package. Before we go into the details regarding how this
        works, a brief history of previous methods of handling devices is in
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linux systems in general traditionally use a static device creation
        method, whereby a great many device nodes are created under
        <tt class="filename">/dev</tt> (sometimes literally thousands of
        nodes), regardless of whether the corresponding hardware devices
        actually exist. This is typically done via a <span><strong class=
        "command">MAKEDEV</strong></span> script, which contains a number of
        calls to the <span><strong class="command">mknod</strong></span>
        program with the relevant major and minor device numbers for every
        possible device that might exist in the world. Using the Udev method,
        only those devices which are detected by the kernel get device nodes
        created for them. Because these device nodes will be created each
        time the system boots, they will be stored on a <tt class=
        "systemitem">tmpfs</tt> file system (a virtual file system that
        resides entirely in system memory). Device nodes do not require much
        space, so the memory that is used is negligible.
      </p>

          <h2 class="sect2">
            7.4.1. History
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          In February 2000, a new filesystem called <tt class=
          "systemitem">devfs</tt> was merged into the 2.3.46 kernel and was
          made available during the 2.4 series of stable kernels. Although it
          was present in the kernel source itself, this method of creating
          devices dynamically never received overwhelming support from the
          core kernel developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main problem with the approach adopted by <tt class=
          "systemitem">devfs</tt> was the way it handled device detection,
          creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device node naming,
          was perhaps the most critical. It is generally accepted that if
          device names are allowed to be configurable, then the device naming
          policy should be up to a system administrator, not imposed on them
          by any particular developer(s). The <tt class=
          "systemitem">devfs</tt> file system also suffers from race
          conditions that are inherent in its design and cannot be fixed
          without a substantial revision to the kernel. It has also been
          marked as deprecated due to a lack of recent maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the development of the unstable 2.5 kernel tree, later
          released as the 2.6 series of stable kernels, a new virtual
          filesystem called <tt class="systemitem">sysfs</tt> came to be. The
          job of <tt class="systemitem">sysfs</tt> is to export a view of the
          system's hardrware configuration to userspace processes. With this
          userspace-visible representation, the possibility of seeing a
          userspace replacement for <tt class="systemitem">devfs</tt> became
          much more realistic.

            7.4.2. Udev Implementation
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The <tt class="systemitem">sysfs</tt> filesystem was mentioned
          briefly above. One may wonder how <tt class="systemitem">sysfs</tt>
          knows about the devices present on a system and what device numbers
          should be used for them. Drivers that have been compiled into the
          kernel directly register their objects with <tt class=
          "systemitem">sysfs</tt> as they are detected by the kernel. For
          drivers compiled as modules, this registration will happen when the
          module is loaded. Once the <tt class="systemitem">sysfs</tt>
          filesystem is mounted (on <tt class="filename">/sys</tt>), data
          which the built-in drivers registered with <tt class=
          "systemitem">sysfs</tt> are available to userspace processes and to
          <span><strong class="command">udev</strong></span> for device node
          creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span><strong class="command">S10udev</strong></span>
          initscript takes care of creating these device nodes when Linux is
          booted. This script starts by registering <span><strong class=
          "command">/sbin/udevsend</strong></span> as a hotplug event
          handler. Hotplug events (discussed below) are not usually generated
          during this stage, but <span><strong class=
          "command">udev</strong></span> is registered just in case they do
          occur. The <span><strong class="command">udevstart</strong></span>
          program then walks through the <tt class="systemitem">/sys</tt>
          filesystem and creates devices under <tt class="filename">/dev</tt>
          that match the descriptions. For example, <tt class=
          "filename">/sys/class/tty/vcs/dev</tt> contains the string
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">7:0</span>&rdquo; This string is used by
          <span><strong class="command">udevstart</strong></span> to create
          <tt class="filename">/dev/vcs</tt> with major number <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>7</em></span> and minor <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>0</em></span>. The names and permissions of the
          nodes created under the <tt class="filename">/dev</tt> directory
          are configured according to the rules specified in the files within
          the <tt class="filename">/etc/udev/rules.d/</tt> directory. These
          are numbered in a similar fashion to the LFS-Bootscripts package.
          If <span><strong class="command">udev</strong></span> can't find a
          rule for the device it is creating, it will default permissions to
          <span class="emphasis"><em>660</em></span> and ownership to
          <span class="emphasis"><em>root:root</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the above stage is complete, all devices that were already
          present and have compiled-in drivers will be available for use.
          This leads us to the devices that have modular drivers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, we mentioned the concept of a &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">hotplug event handler.</span>&rdquo; When a new device
          connection is detected by the kernel, the kernel will generate a
          hotplug event and look at the file <tt class=
          "filename">/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug</tt> to determine the userspace
          program that handles the device's connection. The
          <span><strong class="command">udev</strong></span> bootscript
          registered <span><strong class="command">udevsend</strong></span>
          as this handler. When these hotplug events are generated, the
          kernel will tell <span><strong class="command">udev</strong></span>
          to check the <tt class="filename">/sys</tt> filesystem for the
          information pertaining to this new device and create the <tt class=
          "filename">/dev</tt> entry for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings us to one problem that exists with <span><strong class=
          "command">udev</strong></span>, and likewise with <tt class=
          "systemitem">devfs</tt> before it. It is commonly referred to as
          the &ldquo;<span class="quote">chicken and egg</span>&rdquo;
          problem. Most Linux distributions handle loading modules via
          entries in <tt class="filename">/etc/modules.conf</tt>. Access to a
          device node causes the appropriate kernel module to load. With
          <span><strong class="command">udev</strong></span>, this method
          will not work because the device node does not exist until the
          module is loaded. To solve this, the <span><strong class=
          "command">S05modules</strong></span> bootscript was added to the
          LFS-Bootscripts package, along with the <tt class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/modules</tt> file. By adding module names
          to the <tt class="filename">modules</tt> file, these modules will
          be loaded when the computer starts up. This allows
          <span><strong class="command">udev</strong></span> to detect the
          devices and create the appropriate device nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that on slower machines or for drivers that create a lot of
          device nodes, the process of creating devices may take a few
          seconds to complete. This means that some device nodes may not be
          immediately accessible.

          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          When you plug in a device, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) MP3
          player, the kernel recognizes that the device is now connected and
          generates a hotplug event. If the driver is already loaded (either
          because it was compiled into the kernel or because it was loaded
          via the <span><strong class="command">S05modules</strong></span>
          bootscript), <span><strong class="command">udev</strong></span>
          will be called upon to create the relevant device node(s) according
          to the <tt class="systemitem">sysfs</tt> data available in
          <tt class="filename">/sys</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the driver for the just plugged in device is available as a
          module but currently unloaded, the Hotplug package will load the
          appropriate module and make this device available by creating the
          device node(s) for it.

            7.4.4. Problems with Creating Devices
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          There are a few known problems when it comes to automatically
          creating device nodes:
        </p>
        <p>
          1) A kernel driver may not export its data to <tt class=
          "systemitem">sysfs</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is most common with third party drivers from outside the
          kernel tree. Udev will be unable to automatically create device
          nodes for such drivers. Use the <tt class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/createfiles</tt> configuration file to
          manually create the devices. Consult the <tt class=
          "filename">devices.txt</tt> file inside the kernel documentation or
          the documentation for that driver to find the proper major/minor
          numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2) A non-hardware device is required. This is most common with the
          Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) project's Open Sound
          System (OSS) compatibility module. These types of devices can be
          handled in one of two ways:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Adding the module names to <tt class=
                "filename">/etc/sysconfig/modules</tt>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Using an &ldquo;<span class="quote">install</span>&rdquo;
                line in <tt class="filename">/etc/modprobe.conf</tt>. This
                tells the <span><strong class=
                "command">modprobe</strong></span> command
                &ldquo;<span class="quote">when loading this module, also
                load this other module, at the same time.</span>&rdquo; For
                example:
              </p>
              <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
              "command">install snd-pcm modprobe -i snd-pcm ; modprobe \
    snd-pcm-oss ; true</kbd></pre>
              <p>
                This will cause the system to load both the <span class=
                "emphasis"><em>snd-pcm</em></span> and <span class=
                "emphasis"><em>snd-pcm-oss</em></span> modules when any
                request is made to load the driver <span class=
                "emphasis"><em>snd-pcm</em></span>.
