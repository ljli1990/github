          My adventures in Linux began in 1998 when I downloaded and
          installed my first distribution. After working with it for a while,
          I discovered issues I definitely would have liked to see improved
          upon. For example, I didn't like the arrangement of the bootscripts
          or the way programs were configured by default. I tried a number of
          alternative distributions to address these issues, yet each had its
          pros and cons. Finally, I realized that if I wanted full
          satisfaction from my Linux system, I would have to build my own
          from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does this mean? I resolved not to use pre-compiled packages of
          any kind, nor CD-ROMs or boot disks that would install basic
          utilities. I would use my current Linux system to develop my own
          customized system. This &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">perfect</span>&rdquo; Linux system would then have the
          strengths of various systems without their associated weaknesses.
          In the beginning, the idea was rather daunting, but I remained
          committed to the idea that a system could be built that would
          conform to my needs and desires rather than to a standard that just
          did not fit what I was looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and
          compile-time errors, I created a custom-built Linux system that was
          fully operational and suitable to individual needs. This process
          also allowed me to create compact and streamlined Linux systems
          which are faster and take up less space than traditional operating
          systems. I called this system a Linux From Scratch system, or an
          LFS system for short.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the
          Linux community, it became apparent that there was sustained
          interest in the ideas set forth in my Linux adventures. Such
          custom-built LFS systems serve not only to meet user specifications
          and requirements, but also serve as an ideal learning opportunity
          for programmers and system administrators to enhance their Linux
          skills. Out of this broadened interest, the Linux From Scratch
          Project was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          This <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux From Scratch</em></span> book
          provides readers with the background and instruction to design and
          build custom Linux systems. This book highlights the Linux from
          Scratch project and the benefits of using this system. Users can
          dictate all aspects of their system, including directory layout,
          script setup, and security. The resulting system will be compiled
          completely from the source code, and the user will be able to
          specify where, why, and how programs are installed. This book
          allows readers to fully customize Linux systems to their own needs
          and allows users more control over their system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you will have a great time working on your own LFS system,
          and enjoy the numerous benefits of having a system that is truly
          <span class="emphasis"><em>your own</em></span>.
