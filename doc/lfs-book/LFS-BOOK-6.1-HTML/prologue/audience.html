        There are many reasons why somebody would want to read this book. The
        principal reason is to install a Linux system from the source code. A
        question many people raise is, &ldquo;<span class="quote">why go
        through all the hassle of manually building a Linux system from
        scratch when you can just download and install an existing
        one?</span>&rdquo; That is a good question and is the impetus for
        this section of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        One important reason for LFS's existence is to help people learn how
        a Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS system
        helps demonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work together
        and depend on each other. One of the best things that this learning
        experience provides is the ability to customize Linux to your own
        tastes and needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key benefit of LFS is that it allows users to have more control
        over the system without relying on someone else's Linux
        implementation. With LFS, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>
        are in the driver's seat and dictate every aspect of the system, such
        as the directory layout and bootscript setup. You also dictate where,
        why, and how programs are installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit of LFS is the ability to create a very compact Linux
        system. When installing a regular distribution, one is often forced
        to include several programs which are probably never used. These
        programs waste disk space, or worse, CPU cycles. It is not difficult
        to build an LFS system of less than 100 megabytes (MB), which is
        substantially smaller than the majority of existing installations.
        Does this still sound like a lot of space? A few of us have been
        working on creating a very small embedded LFS system. We successfully
        built a system that was specialized to run the Apache web server with
        approximately 8MB of disk space used. Further stripping could bring
        this down to 5 MB or less. Try that with a regular distribution! This
        is only one of the many benefits of designing your own Linux
        implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could compare Linux distributions to a hamburger purchased at a
        fast-food restaurant&mdash;you have no idea what might be in what you
        are eating. LFS, on the other hand, does not give you a hamburger.
        Rather, LFS provides the recipe to make the exact hamburger desired.
        This allows users to review the recipe, omit unwanted ingredients,
        and add your own ingredients to enhance the flavor of the burger.
        When you are satisfied with the recipe, move on to preparing it. It
        can be made to exact specifications&mdash;broil it, bake it, deep-fry
        it, or barbecue it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another analogy that we can use is that of comparing LFS with a
        finished house. LFS provides the skeletal plan of a house, but it is
        up to you to build it. LFS maintains the freedom to adjust plans
        throughout the process, customizing it to the user's needs and
        preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        An additional advantage of a custom built Linux system is security.
        By compiling the entire system from source code, you are empowered to
        audit everything and apply all the security patches desired. It is no
        longer necessary to wait for somebody else to compile binary packages
        that fix a security hole. Unless you examine the patch and implement
        it yourself, you have no guarantee that the new binary package was
        built correctly and adequately fixes the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usable
        foundation-level system. Readers who do not wish to build their own
        Linux system from scratch may not benefit from the information in
        this book. If you only want to know what happens while the computer
        boots, we recommend the &ldquo;<span class="quote">From Power Up To
        Bash Prompt</span>&rdquo; HOWTO located at <a href=
        "http://axiom.anu.edu.au/~okeefe/p2b/"><i>http://axiom.anu.edu.au/~okeefe/p2b/</i></a>
        or on The Linux Documentation Project's (TLDP) website at <a href=
        "http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html"><i>
        http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html</i></a>.
        The HOWTO builds a system which is similar to that of this book, but
        it focuses strictly on creating a system capable of booting to a BASH
        prompt. Consider your objective. If you wish to build a Linux system
        while learning along the way, then this book is your best choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are too many good reasons to build your own LFS system to list
        them all here. This section is only the tip of the iceberg. As you
        continue in your LFS experience, you will find the power that
        information and knowledge truly bring.
