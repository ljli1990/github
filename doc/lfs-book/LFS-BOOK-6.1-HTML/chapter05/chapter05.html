        <p>
          This chapter shows how to compile and install a minimal Linux
          system. This system will contain just enough tools to start
          constructing the final LFS system in <a href=
          "../chapter06/chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a> and allow a working
          environment with more user convenience than a minimum environment
          would.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two steps in building this minimal system. The first step
          is to build a new and host-independent toolchain (compiler,
          assembler, linker, libraries, and a few useful utilities). The
          second step uses this toolchain to build the other essential tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The files compiled in this chapter will be installed under the
          <tt class="filename">$LFS/tools</tt> directory to keep them
          separate from the files installed in the next chapter and the host
          production directories. Since the packages compiled here are
          temporary, we do not want them to pollute the soon-to-be LFS
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before issuing the build instructions for a package, the package
          should be unpacked as user <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>lfs</em></span>, and a <span><strong class=
          "command">cd</strong></span> into the created directory should be
          performed. The build instructions assume that the
          <span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span> shell is in use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several of the packages are patched before compilation, but only
          when the patch is needed to circumvent a problem. A patch is often
          needed in both this and the next chapter, but sometimes in only one
          or the other. Therefore, do not be concerned if instructions for a
          downloaded patch seem to be missing. Warning messages about
          <span class="emphasis"><em>offset</em></span> or <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>fuzz</em></span> may also be encountered when
          applying a patch. Do not worry about these warnings, as the patch
          was still successfully applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the compilation of most packages, there will be several
          warnings that scroll by on the screen. These are normal and can
          safely be ignored. These warnings are as they appear&mdash;warnings
          about deprecated, but not invalid, use of the C or C++ syntax. C
          standards change fairly often, and some packages still use the
          older standard. This is not a problem, but does prompt the warning.
        </p>
        <p>
          After installing each package, delete its source and build
          directories, unless specifically instructed otherwise. Deleting the
          sources saves space and prevents mis-configuration when the same
          package is reinstalled later. Only three of the packages need to
          retain the source and build directories in order for their contents
          to be used by later commands. Pay special attention to these
          reminders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check one last time that the <tt class="envar">LFS</tt> environment
          variable is set up properly:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">echo $LFS</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          Make sure the output shows the path to the LFS partition's mount
          point, which is <tt class="filename">/mnt/lfs</tt>, using our
          example.
