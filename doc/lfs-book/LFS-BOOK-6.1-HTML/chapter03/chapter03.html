        <p>
          This chapter includes a list of packages that need to be downloaded
          for building a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers
          correspond to versions of the software that are known to work, and
          this book is based on their use. We highly recommend not using
          newer versions because the build commands for one version may not
          work with a newer version. The newest package versions may also
          have problems that require work-arounds. These work-arounds will be
          developed and stabilized in the development version of the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download
          location has changed since this book was published, Google
          (<a href="http://www.google.com/"><i>http://www.google.com/</i></a>)
          provides a useful search engine for most packages. If this search
          is unsuccessful, try one of the alternative means of downloading
          discussed at <a href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/packages.html"><i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/packages.html</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored somewhere
          that is conveniently available throughout the entire build. A
          working directory is also required to unpack the sources and build
          them. <tt class="filename">$LFS/sources</tt> can be used both as
          the place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working
          directory. By using this directory, the required elements will be
          located on the LFS partition and will be available during all
          stages of the building process.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create this directory, execute, as user <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>root</em></span>, the following command before
          starting the download session:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">mkdir $LFS/sources</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          Make this directory writable and sticky. &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">Sticky</span>&rdquo; means that even if multiple users have
          write permission on a directory, only the owner of a file can
          delete the file within a sticky directory. The following command
          will enable the write and sticky modes:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">chmod a+wt $LFS/sources</kbd></pre>
