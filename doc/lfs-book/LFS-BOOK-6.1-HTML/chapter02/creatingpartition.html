          2.2. Creating a New Partition
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Like most other operating systems, LFS is usually installed on a
        dedicated partition. The recommended approach to building an LFS
        system is to use an available empty partition or, if you have enough
        unpartitioned space, to create one. However, an LFS system (in fact
        even multiple LFS systems) may also be installed on a partition
        already occupied by another operating system and the different
        systems will co-exist peacefully. The document <a href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs_next_to_existing_systems.txt">
        <i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs_next_to_existing_systems.txt</i></a>
        explains how to implement this, whereas this book discusses the
        method of using a fresh partition for the installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A minimal system requires a partition of around 1.3 gigabytes (GB).
        This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile the
        packages. However, if the LFS system is intended to be the primary
        Linux system, additional software will probably be installed which
        will require additional space (2-3 GB). The LFS system itself will
        not take up this much room. A large portion of this requirement is to
        provide sufficient free temporary storage. Compiling packages can
        require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after the package
        is installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)
        available for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small
        disk partition as swap space. This is used by the kernel to store
        seldom-used data and leave more memory available for active
        processes. The swap partition for an LFS system can be the same as
        the one used by the host system, in which case it is not necessary to
        create another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start a disk partitioning program such as <span><strong class=
        "command">cfdisk</strong></span> or <span><strong class=
        "command">fdisk</strong></span> with a command line option naming the
        hard disk on which the new partition will be created&mdash;for
        example <tt class="filename">/dev/hda</tt> for the primary Integrated
        Drive Electronics (IDE) disk. Create a Linux native partition and a
        swap partition, if needed. Please refer to <tt class=
        "filename">cfdisk(8)</tt> or <tt class="filename">fdisk(8)</tt> if
        you do not yet know how to use the programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g., <tt class=
        "filename">hda5</tt>). This book will refer to this as the LFS
        partition. Also remember the designation of the swap partition. These
        names will be needed later for the <tt class=
        "filename">/etc/fstab</tt> file.
